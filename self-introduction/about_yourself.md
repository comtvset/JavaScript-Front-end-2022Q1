Hi! Iâ€™d like to tell you a bit about myself.
My name is Vadim. I am 36 years old and I was born in Brest, Belarus.
I went to school in Brest. After that I studied social management at the Belarusian State University in Minsk.
After my graduation I decided to return to Brest, because this is my favorite city in Belarus.
Brest is located on the border with Europe, and this location has allowed me to visit Poland and other European countries frequently.
And now I live in Warsaw, Poland. I like this country and this city because I feel free here. The feeling of freedom is very important to me!
At the moment I am studying Polish because I need it for everyday communication.
I also started studying English with a private tutor.
And what about programming? Why and how have I gone for it?
Since childhood I have been interested in computers and computer technologies. Yet, for me programming has turned out to be not as easy as it seemed initially. But since I am optimistic, I believe that I can make it. If you really want something, you will get it.
I came across the information about Rolling Scopes School by accident about 2 years ago. But in autumn 2021, my wife brought this course to my attention again and I remembered that I had already read about it before.
So this time I decided to give it a try. 
The course is intensive and interesting. The "js30"-related tasks have been especially engaging.
I've also liked the "Pay it forward" principle an I hope that I can return the debt to the school soon.
That's it :)
